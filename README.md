### Pilot study

- Don't forget to check if participants answered all pages of the questionnaires

### Analysis

95% bootstrapped Conf. Int. for the answers to the pre and post questionnaires.

** Remarks ** 
- on the experiment: 
    - people found it very interesting
    - challenges: cutting some of the equipment (the pipe), 
    - suggestions: an introduction on how to use the AR before starting, matching the color in the AR and actual equipment
- on the data: the data structure looks good to me
- on the open answers: maybe we could take two extra minute to ask the participants what they mean by their answer and record that for hte open answer? or instead of having them write 
that part we could proceed to a recorded quick interview, then we transcribe that?

**Questions to clarify**

- which of the pre and post Q are we interested in comparing? for now, as shown in the image, I compare pre_6 (*How would you rate your ability to recall material you have 
learned in a formal setting like a laboratory or a classroom?*) against post_3 (*Rate your ability to recall the flow chemistry procedure*). But I am not sure if those definitions 
are comparable from a chemistry person's standpoint.
